                    This endpoint structures the APOD imagery and associated metadata so that it can be repurposed for other
                    applications. In addition, if the concept_tags parameter is set to True, then keywords derived from the image
                    explanation are returned. These keywords could be used as auto-generated hashtags for twitter or instagram feeds;
                    but generally help with discoverability of relevant imagery.
